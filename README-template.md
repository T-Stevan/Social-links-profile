### What I learned

Using media queries. I noticed that you should observe spacing while
using media queries. Using the right spacing between [@ media screen and *(min-width:800px)] Where the * is placed should have a space.

### Continued development

In future, I would like to integrate JavaScript into my code and also use rem, %, vh instead of simple pixels.
